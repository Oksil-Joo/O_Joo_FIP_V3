### Concept
This is an Oksilâ€™s final integrated assignment. I create a portfolio website based on the HTML/CSS/JAVA Script/ SCSS. The work is responsible for designing, coding, and semantically tagging a responsive HTML5 website. The concept of my website is **Oksil Joo's portfolio**. The inspiration for my creation comes from me, which is The concept of this portfolio is open mind and nature. So, the open mind was expressed using a circle, and nature was expressed through wordmark and Macaw Green.

### Main color
This Portfolio home page is used Macaw Green as the main color, so it was expressed as a Macaw Green circle in the center of the main page. Therefore, it was mainly used in headline background, text, and index pages.
### sub color
As an auxiliary color, Azalea Pink was used to make the color appear mainly when the mouse is raised. Therefore, the hamburger menu is expressed so that the menu comes out from top to bottom when a mouse is clicked using JavaScript.It was induced to go directly to the portfolio page through the portfolio menu on the index
### Typographic
The primary typeface of typography is cochin, which is a font similar to the logotype, and is set as a font that is easy to read and gives a natural feeling. The text font was also unified into Times New Roman, which is easy to read and similar to the headline font.
### Effect,Animation: CSS, Javascript
When you mouse up the image, the portfolio changes from black and white to color and goes to the detail page. The detailed page is made in JavaScript so that an image and an explanation of the image appear when a button is clicked.
Moreover, the Hamburger menu expresses using java script to rotate it, and the main menu can be going down when the mouse clicked.
